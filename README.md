# Rock-Paper-Scissor-Game

Rock, Paper, Scissors is a simple hand game usually played between two people, where each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. The possible shapes are:

Rock (a fist)
Paper (an open hand)
Scissors (a fist with the index and middle fingers extended, forming a V)

Game Rules:
Rock crushes Scissors: Rock wins against Scissors.
Scissors cuts Paper: Scissors wins against Paper.
Paper covers Rock: Paper wins against Rock.

How to Play:
Both players count to three in unison and then simultaneously throw one of the three hand signs.
The outcome is determined by the combination of signs thrown. The winner is the player whose hand sign beats the other. If both players choose the same sign, the game is a tie and usually repeated.
